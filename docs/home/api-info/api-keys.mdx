## Overview

On the [Metriport Developer Dashboard](https://dash.metriport.com/developers), we support generating 2 types of API keys - a Secret Key and a Client Key.

For your security, read through this page to understand the difference between the two keys,
and when it's appropriate to use them.

<Warning>
  If you believe any of your keys have been compromised, you can always revoke
  them on the Settings page by clicking the trash button beside the key. This
  will make the key inactive immediately, and you'll need to subsequenly
  generate a new one.
</Warning>

## Secret Key

The Secret Key will give you full access to the Metriport API. This key has the
ability to perform destructive operations, and as such, we recommend treating it with the same
care as your account password.

Generally, this key should only be used in your backend services, not shared with anyone,
and never exposed in plain text.

<Warning>
  As you probably know, don't commit this key in plain text to your repositories
  either - even if your repos are private.
</Warning>
